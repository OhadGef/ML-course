"Why can't we have racism that's ignorant but nice? You could have stereotypes that are positive about race. You could say, Those Chinese people, they can fly! You know about the Puerto Ricans... they're made of candy!"
"Nobody ever wins an argument. Nobody ever goes, 'Oh, I'm wrong.' Somebody eventually just goes, 'Shut up. We gotta eat, so let's shut up for minute.'"
"I hate when people ask me the time on the street 'cause something happens to me. I just panic. I can't read my watch. When I'm alone, I'm great at reading my watch, but when someone asks me, I just have this anxiety attack, and I just can't make it out... I always end up saying something useless, like, 'It's 20 of 9:40.'"
"I was driving in Manhattan. There's traffic, nobody's moving... The guy behind me is honking just at me. He kept yelling at me. I decided that I'm gonna argue with this guy, but I'm gonna argue about something else. I'm not having his argument; I'm having mine. So, he's like, 'Go!' And I go, 'Well give me back my jacket!' And he stopped. I was like, 'Yeah, you got my jacket! Give it back! I said you could borrow it, not have it! You're stretching it out, you fat pig! Give it back, now!' He got back in his car, and he locked his doors."
"I'm not an atheist. I think god is there and that he is watching and he made us. I just don't give a shit. I don't believe in god. I have zero idea how everything got here. I would personally say that, if i had to make a list of possibles, God would be pretty far down. But if I were to make a list of people that know what the fuck they are talking about, I would be really far down."
You know what hilarious means? Hilarious means so funny that you almost went insane when you heard that shi... its so funny that is almost ruined your life. You're homeless now because you can't cope or reason anymore. Because that hilarious thing just shattered your mind and three months later you got shit and leaves in your hair and you're drenched in pee in the gutter. That's how funny hilarious is.
"Fuck it... That's really the attitude that keeps a family together, it's not we love each other, it's just fuck it, man."
"I'm not condoning rape, obviously. You should never rape anyone. Unless you have a reason like you want to fuck somebody and they won't let you, in which case what other option do you have? How else are you supposed to have an orgasm in their body if you don't rape them, like what the fuck?"
"You can figure out how bad a person you are by how soon after September 11th you masturbated, like how long you waited... and for me it was between the two buildings going down... I had to do it, otherwise they'd win."
"If you're a woman and a guy's ever said anything romantic to you, he just left off the second part that would have made you sick if you could have heard it."
Television for a child creates such a high bar of stimulus that nothing else competes. A beautiful day is absolute crap to a kid who watches tv.
"You're all gonna die. Then you'll be dead for way longer than you're alive, like that's mostly what you're ever gonna be. You're just dead people that didn't die yet."
"I don't think women are better than men, I think men are a lot worse than women."
"I ate too much and masturbated too recently, you know? It's bad to like jerk off and run out the door, 'cause you run into somebody. Oh, she knows... You got to take some time alone to process the shame."
"My bank is the worst. They are screwing me. You know what they did to me? They're charging me money for not having enough money. Apparently, when you're broke, that costs money."
Drugs are so fucking good that they'll ruin your life.
What we've done with our modern food supply is absolute insanity. It's not even real any more. You used to be able to give a kid an apple and they would love it. Kids can't even taste apples any more. Apples taste like paper to kids now.
"It's in the Ten Commandments to not take the Lord's name in vain. Rape isn't up there, by the way. Rape is not a Ten Commandment. But don't say the dude's name with a shitty attitude."
"'I had to sit on the runway for 40 minutes.' Oh my god, really? What happened then, did you fly through the air like a bird, incredibly? Did you soar into the clouds, impossibly? Did you partake in the miracle of human flight and then land softly on giant tires that you couldn't even conceive how they fucking put air in them? You're sitting in a chair in the sky. You're like a Greek myth right now."
"I don't have a gun, but if I did, I would shoot a baby deer in the mouth and feel nothing."
I don't stop eating when I'm full. The meal isn't over when I'm full. It's over when I hate myself.
"I used to like people more, but now I have children and that changes your life in a lot of ways. Like you spend time with people you never would have chosen to spend time with, not in a million years. I spend whole days with people, I'm like, I never would have hung out with you. I didn't choose you. Our children chose each other based on no criteria by the way. They're the same size. They don't care who they make me hang out with."
I never viewed money as being 'my money' I always saw it as 'the money.' It's a resource. If it pools up around me then it needs to be flushed back out into the system.
Friends should always tell you the truth. But please don't.
"Dating is horrible, it's awful. I don't get it. It's like you're standing there: 'Hi. Do you want to have sex and later wish you hadn't?' It's horrible. And it's awkward at 42 because I don't have the body or the drive. I just sit in the car and hope somebody gets in."
It's a positive thing to talk about terrible things and make people laugh about them.
I don't think it makes any sense to try to get anyone to not talk.
"We have white people problems in America. That's what we have, white people problems. You know what that is? That's where your life is amazing, do you just make shit up to be upset about. People in other countries have real problems. Like, Oh, shit. They're cutting off all our heads today. Things like that. Here, we make shit up to be upset about. Like, How come I have to choose a language on the ATM machine? It's bullshit. I shouldn't have to do that. I'm American."
"I've started to kind of hate people, and it's not because I have anything against them. It's just, I enjoy it. It's recreation."
Talking is always positive. That's why I talk too much.
"I like to talk to strangers. I like to go up to people I don't know and just start conversations with them, just start a conversation. Try it. But the way I do it, don't start the conversation in the beginning, just start it in the middle. Try it. Just go up to somebody you don't know and and just go, 'Well how do you think I felt?'"
Who wants to blow their husband? You want to blow a guy that you've been dating. And he's mysterious and you suck his cock and go home. Who wants to blow a guy and then go to IKEA with him all day?
"I got tits now, too. I just got tits! That is a fucked up day in a man's life, when you look in the mirror and you realize, Fuck! I got... Because you don't see them coming, they're sort of pouting out little by little, and then one day they just fuckin' fall a little and that's it, you have tits. And they're there for good. They're not gonna like go back, it's fucking over."
"All these words we use, anybody can be a genius now. It used to be you had to have a thought no one ever had before or you had to invent a number. Now, it's like, Hey, I've got a cup in case we need another cup. Dude, you're a genius!"
"Twitter and Facebook and MySpace; all that stuff makes you warped. We've all basically given ourselves data entry jobs. I've actually heard people say things like, 'Aw shit, I have to update my Twitter.' Really? You have to? That's a big priority for you?"
"You've got to be optimistic to be single. Stupid. You have to be stupid. That's what optimistic means, you know. It means stupid. An optimist is someone who goes, Hey, maybe something nice will happen! Why the fuck would anything nice ever happen?! What are you stupid?!"
"When I read things like the foundations of capitalism are shattering, I'm like, maybe we need that. Maybe we need some time where we're walking around with a donkey with pots clanging on the sides. Because everything is amazing right now and nobody's happy... In my lifetime, the changes in the world have been incredible. Now we live in an amazing, amazing world and it's wasted on the crappiest generation of just spoiled idiots that don't care, because this what people are like now. They've got their phone and they're like Uh, it won't Give it a second! It's going to space! Can you give it a second to get back from space? Is the speed of light too slow for you?"
"I find that when people laugh really hard, it's usually because they're connecting and identifying in a way that they hadn't considered. That's my payoff. I'm not interested in other people thinking differently. I don't care. I'm not even educated; it's something that I'm not qualified to do. I'm just like yeast - I eat sugar and I shit alcohol. And there's a huge culture that goes with that. Alcohol creates massive shifts in world history, and it changes people's lives. People get pregnant because of alcohol. But the yeast doesn't give a fuck. The yeast isn't going, I really want to help people loosen up and bring passion into Irish people's lives."
It's more fun to experience things when you don't know what's going to happen.
"I think you have to try and fail, because failure gets you closer to what you're good at."
"Gay men have to go through something to own their - who they are. They get beat up. They get ostracized. Whatever they go through, if they survive it, they come out very confident people."
"Every day starts, my eyes open and I reload the program of misery. I open my eyes, remember who I am, what I'm like, and I just go, 'Ugh'."
"Well, when I was younger, I lied all the time, because once you understand the power of lying, it's really like magic because you transform reality for people."
"I'm bored is a useless thing to say. You live in a great, big, vast world that you've seen none percent of."
"People get successful and they start saying, 'Well of course I am! I was chosen! I'm special!' No, you're not."
"I don't like waking up. I feel like staying in bed usually, but I can't because I've got two kids standing next to my bed, just eager to live another day."
"Well, my wife assassinated my sexual identity, and my children are eating my dreams. We don't bother you with that. We just say Great."
"I like New York. This is the only city where you actually have to say things like, 'Hey, that's mine. Don't pee on that.'"
"I read something in the paper that really confused me the other day. It said that 80 percent of the people in New York are minorities... Shouldn't you not call them minorities when they get to be 80 percent of the population? That's a very white attitude, don't you think? I mean, you could take a white guy to Africa and he'd be like 'Look at all the minorities around here! I'm the only majority.'"
"I have a lot of beliefs and I live by none of 'em. That's just the way I am. They're just my beliefs. I just like believing them. I like that part. They're my little believies. They make me feel good about who I am. But if they get in the way of a thing I want, or I want to jack off or something, I fuckin' do that."
"That's a very white attitude. You can take a white guy to Africa, and he'd be like, 'Look at all the minorities they got over here. Jesus!'"
"I'm buying a Cinnabon ' at the airport ' I arrived at. You understand why that's extra disgusting, right? Because when you're at the airport you're leaving from, you can say, Oh, I gotta eat. I need some food, because I might be trapped in the sky forever, so I should eat right now. But I've landed. The trip is over. I'm 20 minutes from my house, where I got bananas and apples and shit. And I'm sitting on my luggage just fucking eating a Cinnabon with a fork and knife."
"I don't care about the weight. You know, I'm lucky; I'm one of those people - I can eat donuts, whatever, and I just get fat."
"I love being married, it's great, but I hate arguing. I hate fighting. You know what I do now? When we get in an argument, I just take her side against me. It's just easier; it goes quicker. She's like, 'What's wrong with you?' And I'm like, 'I know! Damn it! Argh!' She wins most of them anyway. I might as well be on the winning side occasionally."
Being single at 41 after ten years of marriage and two kids is difficult. That's like having a bunch of money in the currency of a country that doesn't exist anymore.
Very few American parents give a crap about how they raise their kids. They put minimal effort into it. Who told you it's a good idea to buy a developing mind a video game?
They charged me 15 dollars. That's how much it costs to only have 20 dollars.
"There's nothing that beats proving you're funny by making a funny thing, and right now there are huge outlets for that, with You Tube and all the other stuff online."
I'm not sure why I'm so often disgusting on stage. I don't always know where it comes from.
"If you do something and people think you're stupid, just go for crazy. You get more respect that way because nobody likes stupid people."
People say 'my phone sucks.' No it doesn't! The shittiest cellphone in the world is a miracle. Your life sucks. Around the phone.
God is like a shitty girlfriend.
There's no real preparing at home for stand-up. You just go and you just do it.
Everything that's difficult you should be able to laugh about.
Kids are like buckets of disease that live in your house.
"Some things I think are very conservative, or very liberal. I think when someone falls into one category for everything, I'm very suspicious. It doesn't make sense to me that you'd have the same solution to every issue."
"I've never sucked a dick. Isn't that weird? My whole life! That's weird to me. It is! It's weird. Because almost everybody has sucked a dick, when you think about it, most people on earth suck dicks. It's true. Because 51% of the population are women and they suck dicks. Then there's all the gay guys who suck dicks. Then there's all the straight guys who have been forced to suck a dick under various circumstances. So there's only like a thousand of us out there who never blew anyone. Just a bunch of selfish assholes that are fuckin' gettin' blown and not blowin' back, you know."
I'm pretty sure 100% of animal sex is rape. It's just all rape.
"One time, I threw a candy wrapper on the street. I was with a friend who said to me, You just littered on the street! Don't you care about the environment? And I thought about it, and I said, You know what? This isn't the environment. This is New York City. New York City is not the environment. New York City is a giant piece of litter. Next to Mexico City, it's the shittiest piece of litter in the world. Just a pussy, runny, smokin', stinkin' piece of litter."
"The only road to good shows is bad ones. Just go start having a bad time, and if you don't give up, you will get better."
"When girls go wild, they show their tits to people. When women go wild, they kill men and drown their kids in a tub."
"When two kids are being completely berserk, and they're naked and throwing food around, sometimes I just let it go because I can see a future where they're going to be dressed, and they're going to be at school. So I kind of let stuff go sometimes."
"Divorce is always good news. I know that sounds weird, but it's true because no good marriage has ever ended in divorce ' That would be sad. If two people were married and they were really and they just had a great thing and then they got divorced, that would be really sad. But that has happened zero times."
I had five dollars in the bank that I couldn't have for three days until they charged me another 15. Leaving me with -10. What does that mean? I don't even have no money any more. I wish I had nothing. But I don't have it. I don't have that much. I have not ten. Negative ten. I can't afford to buy something that doesn't cost anything. I can only afford to get something that costs you give me ten dollars.
"Life's too short to be an asshole, as an employer or as an employee."
How many advantages can one person have? I'm a white man!
Most people are dead. Hitler. Ray Charles. Some other guys. But mostly those two.
I don't have a room full of writers pitching ideas. It's just me out of my head.
"Most Americans have so much crap, that you could lose most of it and still have way more stuff than the average Canadian."
"I don't know if you've ever had just five dollars in the bank, but I've found that if that's all you have, you can't get it out."
"I've always benefited from knowing machines well, because it's freedom, it gives you freedom, I always knew that."
"First of all, I came immediately, and also I started farting as I came. That's how my sex life started. Fucking shame and depression."
"Human kindness has no reward. You should give to others in every way you see. You should expect absolutely nothing from anyone. It should be your goal to love every human you encounter. All human suffering that you're aware of and continues without your effort to stop it becomes your crime. Humans are always evolving. If you do one thing that if done by every human would destroy the world, that makes you Hitler... I don't live by any of those. But I believe them all very strongly."
"I've had, what, two years? Probably five good years. Before that I had twenty years of uncertainty and suffering and ego destruction and poverty. All those things. That'll always outweigh the good times."
"After you do standup for for, like, five years, you're kind of screwed because you have no other skills. You can't get other jobs. It's like being in prison: you're not suitable for any other career."
"I do have very deep, fond memories of my family in Mexico City, but I also remember feeling funny for not speaking English - I was basically an immigrant. But I picked up the language fast and soon I knew that I wanted to be a writer."
I wish I could keep a journal. I have a lot of journals with one page half written in. I sometimes will write myself a quick email on my Blackberry when I think of something.
"Sometimes I just want to tell a story regardless of whether it fits what the show is saying. I've been in a lot of writing rooms where somebody says an idea and everyone's dying, like laughing so they're delirious. It's like a black hole in a good way, everything starts to fall into it, you know what I mean."
"There's a need to perfect things in a writers' room, and that can take a lot of fun out of a show sometimes. It's a struggle. It depends on your personality. Some people love working with a writing staff. I had a great writing staff on Lucky Louie, but it sometimes felt like Congress or something."
"There's a huge amount of work that goes into placating a network in regular television. It's literally 70% or 80% of your workload, is showing them the material, getting their notes and presenting it to them and making sure they weigh in. It's a huge amount of work."
I really love Barack Obama. Sorry if that's like 'Ew. The president. That's lame.' I love Barack Obama. What a great man. I'm so lucky to have voted for that guy.
"To me, comedies are usually the least funny movies. Movies that are actually a comedy are usually not all that funny. To me Goodfellas and Raging Bull are two of the funniest movies I ever saw."
"Bill Gates has 90 billion dollars. If I had 90 billion dollars, I wouldn't have it for long because I would just dream of all the crazy stuff I could do with it. This guy, 90 billion dollars. He could buy every baseball team and make them all wear dresses and still have 88 billion dollars."
"Well, I think likability is an overused word. I don't watch people 'cause I like them; I watch them because they're compelling. Sympathetic is a little different. Likable just thins you out. Working to make a character likable is what kills most TV shows."
I'd love to have a shitty job. I couldn't hold any down. Standup was the only thing I could stick with. I'm an idiot that way.
My dick is too aware that your pussy is a chamber of financial ruin!
"I'd like to name my kid a whole phrase. You know, something like Ladies and Gentlemen. That'll be a cool name for a kid. This is my son, Ladies and Gentlemen! Then, when he gets out of hand, I get to go, Ladies and Gentlemen, please!"
I do actually use a boxing trainer when I train for stand-up.
"A lot of the struggle I had with movies is I really loved moments and tones and feelings in a scene, and I loved creating those, but I never really had great stories to string them together."
Perception is created and twisted so quickly.
"I've learned from experience that if you work harder at it, and apply more energy and time to it, and more consistency, you get a better result. It comes from the work."
"I'm close to my audience. I think I have more tools in my box than other guys who might try it. Also, I know how to do this stuff. I know how to write and shoot and edit. I'm technically adept and that helped with the website. You need a big skill set."
"If you study something and you find all this stuff about it, you just went skin deep, so if you keep going and going, you should be left with a fucking mess of unanswered questions."
"You could drive a rental car until you don't want it. Just get out of it while it's moving and just walk away. No, I don't feel like being in that car any longer. Just call Hertz. Hi, your car is drifting into the intersection of 28th and Broadway, if you're interested. It's now your problem."
"Sorry, Americans only buy things that come from suffering. They just enjoy it more when they know someones getting hurt."
"The Greatest Generation gets too much credit. Those World War II guys, if they had all the shit we have today, they'd be assholes too. It's just circumstantial. It's what you're called on to do that makes you great. We haven't been called on to do anything but buy shit and get fat."
"When I am in a hotel, and I turn off the lights and the TV, I just freak out. I turn the TV back on and don't get any sleep."
"To me the goal of comedy is to just laugh, which is a really high hearted thing, visceral connection and reaction."
"I like being full, every day, with stuff that I have to do."
"I don't know what it's like to be an actor, where if your show gets canceled, really you're just a bum."
"Plenty of crazy people in New York. There are so many crazy people here, I think it's like one out of every one person is completely out of their mind."
"I did a show in New Jersey in the auditorium of a technical high school. Technical high school, that's where dreams are narrowed down. We tell our children, You can do anything you want. Their whole lives. You can do anything! But this place, we take kids - they're 15, they're young - and we tell them, You can do eight things. We got it down to eight for you."
I've had soccer moms come up and tell me they can relate when I say that I want to throw my baby in the trash.
"A man will cut your arm off and throw it in a river, but he'll leave you as a human being intact. He won't fuck with who you are. Women are non-violent, but they will shit inside of your heart."
"People are too afraid of uptown. A lot of people will tell you, like, 'Don't go to Harlem. You can never go there 'cause as soon as you get there, they kill you.' That's what people think. As soon as you arrive in Harlem, someone just stabs you in the face right away... That's people's image of Harlem: just everyone standing around waiting for lost white people to kill all day."
"Last week I got a flu that I caught, 'cause my daughter coughed ' into my mouth."
Cars and cameras are the two things I let myself be materialistic about. I don't care about other stuff.
"I did that on a date once - I was wearing a bathing suit under my pants because I didn't do laundry. She wouldn't have known except for I had that white string flapping outside of my fly. She was like, 'What do you have - a tampon in there? What the hell's wrong with you?'"
"I can't sit down and write jokes. I just flows in from some maddeningly elusive place. Believe me, if I had an Alaska in my brain, I would drill baby drill, and I'd cum right on Sarah's back while I was there."
"The last jobs I had were fixing cars and covering football games for a local access TV station. As in driving the mobile van to the field, setting up 3 cameras, teaching depressed grownups and interns how to use them and directing the game from the van and then wanting to kill myself."
"I really think it's crazy that we hit our kids. It really is. Here's the crazy part about it. Kids are the only people in the world that you're allowed to hit. Do you realize that? They're the most vulnerable and they're the most destroyed by being hit, but it's totally OK to hit them. And they're the only ones! If you hit a dog, they fucking will put you in jail for that shit."
"My last name is Szekely. Sounds like Saykay. When I was a little kid I had an instructor in camp who called me Shnizneckely. He would make fun of my name and it hurt my feelings because I was a little pussy and I cried. He said, 'Well, how do you say it?' I said, Seekay. So he wrote 'C.K' on my jersey and everything. He made my name 'C.K' and I just stuck with it."
"We spend all our time now on customer service phone calls. I used to read when I was on the toilet, but now that's when I make customer service calls."
"The other kid we have she's a girl and she's four. And she's also a fuckin' asshole. It's true man, I'm serious. I say that with no remorse. Fucking asshole, she's a douchebag. She is! Fucking jerk."
America's a family. We all yell at each other. It all works out.
"When you first get married, you have a relationship that's so important to you, and you're working on it together. But then you have a kid. And you look at your kid and you go, Holy shit, this is my child. She has my DNA. She has my name. I would die for her. And you look at your spouse and go, Who the fuck are you? You're a stranger."
"One thing I learned from drinking is that if you ever go Christmas caroling, you should go with a group of people. And also go sometime in December."
"Whenever single people complain about anything, I really want them to shut the fuck up. First of all, if you're single, your life has no consequence on the earth. Even if you're helping people aggressively, which you're fucking not, nobody gives a shit what happens to you. You can die, and it actually doesn't matter. It doesn't. Your mother will cry or whatever, but otherwise, nobody gives a shit."
"I've had two great years, probably five good years. So I had 20 years of just kind of uncertainty and suffering and ego destruction and poverty. All these things. There's no way I'm ever going to catch up to the misery years. It's impossible... If I don't do anything dumb or I don't get a disease or something, and then I've got to five to eight years I think where it'll really be great and then it will start to degenerate like uranium, you know?"
"I just always loved comedy and I really wanted to be good at it. And it was heartbreaking, 'cause I started and I wasn't good at it. I was only 17-years-old, so I had a lot to learn about life in general. But I just kept on trying. I was young enough and stupid enough and I had no other choice. I had nothing else I was good at."
"I grew up in Boston, and in Boston, people just beat the shit out of each other for no reason. They just beat the shit out of each other. But I kinda think you need that to keep quality control 'cause in places where it doesn't have it, they're too free."
Life is full of horrible mistakes.
"Comedy isn't polite and it isn't correct and it isn't accurate, even. It's just a mess. So that's the way that I approach it."
"I'm not motivated to entertain people through Twitter, so just by having Twitter and not saying anything, I make people mad."
My kids are really easy. I often worry that they're too easy to deal with. They're really nice people.
Everything that people say is testable.
"Comedians work great as actors because they're good under pressure. With a lot of actors, you have to make them feel like everything's going really well to get a good performance out of them. But, if you have a comedian on the set, you can tell them, 'Hey, you really are screwing this up,' and then they just get better."
"We have white people problems in America. You know what that is? That's when your life is amazing, so you just make stuff up to get worried about."
I definitely look at my body and I go: 'Yuck.'
"I don't believe in this idea of, 'That's hate speech, stop it.'"
"I like pressure. Pressure doesn't make me crack. It's enabling. I eat pressure, and there might be times when I get a bad feeling in my gut that this might be too much, but you feel pressure when you're not doing something, you know?"
"Look, it's some cunt coming out of that cunt's cunt."
"The Jackass movies are honestly some of the best movies I've ever seen. I laugh so hard at them. Those guys are geniuses. If they had grown up with a different group of people, they could've been performance artists at Bard College, and people would be writing papers about them."
It's really the kids that do you in. We have two kids. That's fucking stupid. Don't do that.
"Even after 9/11, during the darkest moment of our recent history, the President told us, 'Go shopping.' That's how we were told to uphold American values; go out and fucking buy more shit. So what were we supposed to do?"
"Don't smoke pot. Don't bitch. Don't give up. Go on stage anywhere. Try, fail, repeat."
"Everything's amazing right now, and nobody's happy."
You have to be aware of who you're talking to in an audience.
You can't cancel my stand-up tours. It's impossible. There's too many separate bosses. There is no 'bosses.'
"For my scale, how I grew up and live my life, I'm making plenty of money."
Being popular with an audience is a very rickety ladder to be on.
"Now we live in an amazing, amazing world and it's wasted on the crappiest generation of spoiled idiots."
"The earliest stand-up comedy I was aware of was Bill Cosby. I watched Saturday Night Live as soon as I was aware of it, and Monty Python used to be on PBS at weird hours, so I used to try to watch that. And I loved George Carlin on SNL, that was the first stand-up I ever really remember seeing on TV. And then Steve Martin. I guess I was in fifth or sixth grade when Steve Martin showed up, and he was instantly my idol. And Richard Pryor around the same time too, I sort of became aware of him, though I don't remember the first time I saw him."
"I'm a vulgar, fucked-up degenerate comedian who did drugs. And I'm connecting with Christian mothers and fathers. I love that. That means so much to me."
"When you write from your gut and let the stuff stay flawed and don't let anybody tell you to make it better, it can end up looking like nothing else."
It's been a very old thing for people to gather together and laugh at stuff. The first comedian in America really was Abraham Lincoln. He used to go to a pub near where he lived and stand in front of the fire and he packed the place every night and he would just talk and bust everybody in their guts. He was just a hilarious speaker and that's what he did.
"I remember the day I saw my hair was thinning. I don't remember caring much. I don't care. It's just hair. It never bothered me much. I was pretty young, too. And it happened and is happening very slowly. I have a feeling dead people get really mad when we complain about losing hair."
I think the idea of fucking someone who just watched you perform is... it's just not me.
"My uncles were all funny. My dad wasn't funny, but my uncles were all funny. Now I go back and I like him better than them, they were manipulative funny."
"Credibility lasts about two cycles of bad material, and then you'll probably never get it back. If you let people down, that's really hard to come back from - harder than climbing from nothing to something, even."
It's just a big excuse to say awful things.
"I just don't trust any of it. Every time I read something about how there's been another ridiculous climb of the Dow Jones, there's a part of me that goes, 'This can't be good.' None of this is real money. You know what I mean? It's not like there's actually more of anything. It's just ideas. When people are getting richer and richer but they're not actually producing anything, it can't end well."
"I don't feel those limits when I'm on stage. For some reason, audiences let me get away with things. Remember, it's all comedy. Words. Thoughts. All thoughts are safe and worth exploring."
"There's nowhere I won't go. As long as it's horribly, horribly true and or wrong."
"Farts are - I just refuse to be snobbish about certain shit with comedy. You know, farts come out of your ass and they make a fucking trumpet sound. That shit smelling gas comes out of your ass and it makes a toot sound. What the fuck is not funny about that? It's perfect, it's a perfect joke. It has all the elements."
"I am really tired of looking at my hips. I'm seriously really tired of standing naked in the mirror and staring at my hips for hours and hours while muttering, You hips. You hips need to get it together."
"You have to be really tenacious. You have to keep at it. There are many roads to get there. If you can get yourself into Harvard, that's a good way to go, because every Harvard graduating class, the agencies come trolling around and they'll look for you. So if you go to Harvard, you'll get found there."
Everybody is different. Some comedy is more musical like Steven Wright. His is a pillar of comedy to me. He invented a whole form and all his jokes are poems. So it's different. I wanted to do it like George Carlin. Now I do it like me.
"It's like Platoon. You've got all this fucking stuff; you have an impossible amount of shit to carry, and usually, a kid sometimes too. And I see parents all over the place with skinny little ankles and, you know, with no particular features and they just, ''life's worn them down to a basic like human shape, you know. Their personality and whatever they, the lines in their face and the chiseling is gone. They're just this thing and it's like ant strength, and you just have to, you just have to do it to get through whatever fucking, you know, we've got to get from here to there. And she didn't want to be here any more, and she has to go to the bathroom, and I've got a stroller."
"Nice to be here. I had a good day today I went to a movie. Before the movie now they show you that presentation where they explain that you shouldn't download movies on the Internet because you're hurting all the people that work on them. They need to feed their families so you shouldn't download the movies. And I saw this and I thought, Wow, I had no idea. I didn't know you could download movies on the Internet... I don't care about those people."
"I'm just like yeast - I eat sugar and I shit alcohol. And there's a huge culture that goes with that. Alcohol creates massive shifts in world history, and it changes people's lives. People get pregnant because of alcohol. But the yeast doesn't give a fuck. The yeast isn't going, I really want to help people loosen up and bring passion into Irish people's lives."
"I thought for like five years that when you have sex, you come and one of your balls comes out. That's what I thought happened, that you have to come a ball out of that little whole at the tip of your dick. I was terrified! That's what I thought, you just... Bahh! And you push a ball out and she's screaming and there's blood everywhere...and you can only do it twice and then you're out of balls. That's what I thought. You come and have two babies, and then you just walk around with an empty sack for the rest of your life. Which turned out to be true..."
I've been having a lot of trouble sleeping as we all should. I dunno. You don't live that long. It doesn't matter.
I'm a good citizen. I'm a good father. I recycle and I masturbate.
"I always tell my kids to cut a sandwich in half right when you get it, and the first thought you should have is somebody else. You only ever need half a burger."
"I find that when people laugh it's usually because they're connecting and identifying in a way that they hadn't considered. That's my payoff. I'm not interested in other people thinking differently. I don't care. I'm just like yeast - I eat sugar and I shit alcohol. And there's a huge culture that goes with that. Alcohol creates massive shifts in world history, and it changes people's lives. People get pregnant because of alcohol. But the yeast doesn't give a fuck. The yeast isn't going, I really want to help people loosen up and bring passion into Irish people's lives."
"It's hard to really look at somebody and go: Hey, maybe something nice will happen. You just don't - I know too much about life to have any optimism, because I know even if it's nice, it's going to lead to shit. I know that if you smile at somebody and they smile back, you've just decided that something shitty is going to happen."
"Shut up... let me tell you, let me. Every time I look at your face or even remember it, it wrecks me. And the way you are with me and you're just fun and you shit all over me and you make fun of me and you're real. I don't have enough time in any day to think about you enough... I don't even think about women anymore. I think about you."
"You know, the people who do indie film and decide who gets those little budgets? They're mean, man. They're cold and very cool-oriented."
You can't direct without a good crew.
"Whenever I've encountered a Christian saying, 'Why don't you stop talking like that so I can hear you?' I think, 'Well you're the one putting the earmuffs on, but I wish you could hear me because I like you.'"
"When you're young as a comic, you don't have a lot of leverage."
"When I was first divorced, I started dating younger women, and it was really exciting. But after a while I was like, 'This is just dumb.'"
"When I take my kids out for dinner or lunch, people smile at us."
"When I read things like the foundations of capitalism are shattering, I'm like, maybe we need that. Maybe we need some time where we're walking around with a donkey with pots clanging on the sides."
"When I got divorced, I thought 'Well, there goes my act.'"
"To me, it's very exhilarating when somebody else does a great thing, and it's not me."
"To me, art supplies are always okay to buy."
"There's two kinds of press that you get when you put out a TV show: The reviews, and the people that just decide what the reviews say."
There's no such thing as a cheap laugh.
"There's been a lot of simple vilification of right-wing people. It's really easy to say, 'Well, you're Christian, you're anti-this and that, and I hate you.' But to me, it's more interesting to say, 'What is this person like and how do they really think?'"
"The thing is, comedy's gone in a weird direction. People are really into ironic comedy and fakeness and cleverness."
"The problem is, the more famous you get, the more people see you who didn't choose to."
The only pitch I have to movie people is the same as this one: Just give me $8 million. I'm not telling you what it's about and I'm not telling you who's in it.
"Technically, I've learned that having good legs and wind is good for being on stage. You have to be in shape and have endurance."
Sometimes I try to take a nap before shows. That clears my head.
Some entertainers don't pay attention to what's going on around them.
"Pushing the envelope' sort of implies that you're inside the envelope with everyone else, and you're trying to find the edges on the outsides."
People don't talk to me on airplanes.
"Oh, I love stand-up."
"Most people are dead. Did you know that? It's true, out of all the people that ever were, almost all of them are dead."
"Life isn't something you possess. It's something you take part in, and you witness."
It's kind of awkward to eat alone in a restaurant because everybody's looking at me.
"It's hard to know where your thoughts come from, especially when you have a thirst for material because you need it professionally."
It's easier to cancel a show if it's expensive.
"If you're a cartoon character or most TV characters, sure, you'll fight, because the punches are juicy-sounding and they don't leave marks. But in real life, if somebody punches you in the eye, it doesn't make any noise and your eye is swollen for, like, six months. It's a nightmare to get punched in the eye."
"If I owned a network, I would never let a guy just put people on without telling me who they are."
"If I do something for my kids, I get a medal, because most fathers don't."
"I've tried to do away with lying in my life in the last few years, but it's hard."
I've met a lot of people who've lost their jobs and they still have a sense of humor.
I'm not a political comedian. That's just not what I do.
I'm enjoying the work while I get it right now.
I would rather be with my kids than anybody else.
"I wish I could know everything ever, like that would be my wish - that's what I hope heaven is, that they tell you who shot JFK and all that stuff."
I thought about going to NYU film school - that was this ideal to me. But I didn't make any kind of grades in high school.
I think one reason TV has always done well is because there is something comforting where you kind of know what you're going to be taken through.
"I think I'm past any window where I'm suddenly going to become surprisingly ripped so that people go, 'Oh, my God, what happened to you?'"
I spend enough time onscreen looking hangdog and depressed.
I love comedians. They're my community.
I like all ladies of all different ages.
I know what it's like to have a bunch of material that's working that you don't care about. You want to die.
"I have a crazy amount of different jobs, so the way I manage that is to not do more than one at a time. It's like old computers that had small memory chips, they would do something called swapping, where they would fill the memory with one task, do it and get it out."
"I grew up watching all these crazy movies, European movies and stuff, and I guess that I always laughed at things that were a little more offbeat."
"I get mad like anybody else does, but being able to laugh about getting mad is very healthy, and my kids know that."
"I don't like comedy. I like funny things. I don't like comedy. Like, comedy movies are just, 'Oh Jesus.'"
I do feel a lot of times like I'm out of my league with my kids in terms of what my responsibility is.
I could never sit down and write jokes.
"Breaking records is not something you expect to be doing. That's like a sports thing, it's not usually a comedy and writing thing."
"Anytime you see a bit where some stranger does something to me, it's me."
"A lot of TV is put together by teams, by writing staffs and several different directors. It's a great, very smart way to make television. It's worked for however long TV's been around."
A household name is like ketchup. Everybody wants ketchup. Ketchup doesn't hurt anybody.

"There's a woman I see who's not my therapist, but she's like an old friend who's a therapist in profession. She lets me talk to her like a therapist once in a while, and she does a great thing. Whenever I have a big dilemma, like this is a big problem in my life, she always says, 'Wow, you're going to have to figure that out.'"
"My ex-wife, she really didn't like the material that I did. And that's something I regret, that I wasn't more careful about making sure that she was O.K. with it. I just sort of didn't ask. So that's how that goes."
"I was a nerd growing up, and I'm a little antisocial and awkward."
I don't have a brother in real life.
A very painful part of being a parent is having really negative feelings about your children when you love them so much.
"There are people that really live by doing the right thing, but I don't know what that is, I'm really curious about that. I'm really curious about what people think they're doing when they're doing something evil, casually. I think it's really interesting, that we benefit from suffering so much, and we excuse ourselves from it."
